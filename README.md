# WebStore

##Setup

- Clone the repository
- Go to folder
- run bower init 
- start any http server in the root directory
- have fun

## What I would like to finish if had more time:

- Write a breadcrumps controller, to highight active step and to block inactive, that user can not access
- Make form validation better
- Update the design and probably use another library

## Why I chose AngularJs?

Actually, I would like to write it in React + Flux, but as I was limited in time, 
Angular could do better in this case.
